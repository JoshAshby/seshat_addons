A Few Minor Warnings
--------------------

#. I have litterally NO clue what I am doing. Use at your own risk.
#. I'm only a second year university student, and software
   isn't even my major; I'm working towards an Electrical and Computer
   Engineering degree, so not only do I have limited time to keep this
   maintained, but I also probably won't write the best code ever.
#. This project follows the semantic versioning specs. All Minor and
   patch versions will not break the major versions API, however an bump of the
   major version signifies that backwards compatibility will most likely be
   broken.


Documentation

All code for this can be found online at
`github <https://github.com/JoshAshby/seshat>`__.
If something is broken, or a feature is missing, please submit a pull request
or open an issue. Most things I probably won't have time to get around to
looking at too deeply, so if you want it fixed, a pull request is the way
to go. Besides that, I'm releasing this under the GPLv3 License as found in the
``LICENSE.txt`` file. Enjoy!
